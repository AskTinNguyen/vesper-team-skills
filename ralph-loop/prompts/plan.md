# Planning Task

Create an implementation plan with user stories from the PRD below.

## PRD Content

{{PRD_CONTENT}}

## Output Format

Create stories in this format in the PRD file (`{{PRD_PATH}}`):

```markdown
## User Stories

### [ ] US-001: Story title

**As a** [user type]
**I want** [feature]
**So that** [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### [ ] US-002: Next story title
...
```

## Guidelines

1. **Order by dependency** - Stories should be implementable in sequence
2. **One feature per story** - Keep stories focused and atomic
3. **Clear acceptance criteria** - Testable, specific requirements
4. **Reasonable scope** - Each story completable in one iteration

## After Planning

1. Review the stories for completeness
2. Ensure stories are ordered by implementation priority
3. Save the updated PRD with stories added
