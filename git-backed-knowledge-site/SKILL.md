description: Build a password-gated, git-backed wiki/documentation site (Next.js block-content docs site + JSON-per-section git CMS + Vercel pipeline) the way the NineTails Workshop was built. Use when asked to create a knowledge base, internal wiki, team documentation site, onboarding workshop site, or "site like the NineTails Workshop" — especially when both humans and agents must edit content and deploys run on Vercel.

# Git-Backed Knowledge Site (the "Workshop" pattern)

Replicates the NineTails Workshop setup: a beautiful chapter-book documentation
site where content is plain JSON in git, anyone with the site password can edit
in-browser with live preview, agents edit via HTTP or git, and every change is
an attributed, revertable commit that auto-deploys.

**Reference implementation (copy from it liberally):**
`/Users/tinnguyen/Projects/ninetails-workshop` · https://github.com/AskTinNguyen/ninetails-workshop
Live example: https://ninetails-workshop.vercel.app (gate passphrase in that repo's history/env).

## When to use
- New internal wiki / team knowledge base / onboarding "workshop" site.
- Docs site where non-engineers AND agents must edit content safely.
- Any "learn-inference.com-style" chapter-book knowledge product.

## Architecture (the 8 pillars)

1. **Stack**: Next.js App Router (beware: middleware is renamed `src/proxy.ts` in Next 16+ — read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`), Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens, strict TS, pnpm, static generation via `generateStaticParams`.
2. **Content contract first**: `src/content/types.ts` — a discriminated-union `Block` model (lead/p/h2/h3/list/callout/media/code/table/checklist/terms/quote/cards/steps) — plus `src/content/manifest.ts` (chapters → sections with slug/title/summary/minutes/priority + provenance fields `status/owner/proof/source`). Everything renders through ONE `BlockRenderer`, so all pages stay visually consistent and an editor preview is pixel-exact for free.
3. **Content storage**: one JSON file per section at `content/sections/<chapter>/<section>.json` (`Block[]`). A `scripts/build-content.mjs` prebuild/predev step validates every file against a zod mirror of the Block schema and emits a gitignored `generated-content.ts`; consumers import `CHAPTER_CONTENT` from a stable barrel. Malformed content fails the build, never the site.
4. **Docs shell**: sidebar with numbered chapter groups, breadcrumbs, on-page TOC (scroll-spy), reading progress, prev/next in book order, ⌘K search (title/summary fuzzy + full-text body matches with highlighted snippets from a flattened index), light+dark themes purely via CSS custom properties + `data-theme` + no-flash head script.
5. **Knowledge-governance features** (what makes it a *team* wiki): `/start` onboarding tutorial (N must-know items, localStorage progress, links validated against the manifest at build time); `/status` ledger bucketing every section (canon/wip/needs-review) from deterministic rules over manifest status strings + content callouts; optional `source-audit.ts` publication gate that renders unverified pages as deliberately-withheld panels (owner + missing authority) and excludes their text from search.
6. **Password gate**: `src/proxy.ts` checks an httpOnly cookie = SHA-256 of the passphrase (rotating the password invalidates all sessions); `/gate` page + `/api/gate` POST; `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`; exempt `/api/cms/*` (must return 401 JSON, never redirect agents to an HTML login).
7. **Git CMS**: `GET/POST /api/cms/section` — zod-validate, then commit the section JSON to `main` via the GitHub contents API (serverless holds a fine-grained PAT: ONE repo, Contents read/write only; users/agents never see it). Auth: site-gate cookie grants write when no separate `EDIT_PASSWORD` is set; agents use `Authorization: Bearer CMS_AGENT_TOKEN`. Optimistic concurrency via `baseSha` echo → 409 on conflict. Dev mode (no token) writes to disk. UI: 編輯-style Edit link on every section → `/edit/[chapter]/[section]` structured block editor with live preview **rendered by the real BlockRenderer**; `/changes` commit log with one-click revert.
8. **Pipeline**: GitHub repo connected to Vercel; every save/push auto-deploys (~30–60s). Content edits and code changes ride the same rail.

## Build workflow

1. **Design round before building**: produce 3 genuinely different single-file HTML mockups of the homepage (real fonts via Google Fonts CDN), screenshot them, present with an evaluation table + recommendation, let the user pick. Do not skip this — the first NineTails build shipped a generic look and was rejected. Write the winning direction into `DESIGN.md` as the contract.
2. **Write the contracts yourself, first**: `types.ts`, `manifest.ts` (full IA with real titles/summaries even if body copy is placeholder), and section stubs. This enables conflict-free parallel agent builds.
3. **Parallelize with one-file-per-agent**: shell/design-system agent owns `src/app` + `src/components`; N content agents each own exactly one chapter file; a stabilizer agent builds/lints/audits coverage afterward. (Original build: Workflow of 11 Opus agents.)
4. Placeholder policy if content isn't ready: prose may be lorem, but headings, media labels ("VIDEO — <exact asset>"), table headers, and term names must be REAL so the content swap is mechanical. Media blocks render styled placeholder panels; support `src` for real images later (next/image inside the same frame).
5. Flatten to the JSON content store (pillar 3) BEFORE inviting outside editors, with a **parity gate**: byte-compare old vs generated `CHAPTER_CONTENT` before deleting anything.
6. Add gate, CMS, governance features. Verify with Playwright at 1440+390 in BOTH themes, and LOOK at the screenshots.

## Guardrails (each cost real debugging time)

- **Vercel silently BLOCKS deploys for unassociated commit authors** (`COMMIT_AUTHOR_REQUIRED`). Every commit — human, agent, and CMS-generated — must use a GitHub-associated identity, e.g. `<id>+<user>@users.noreply.github.com`. Put editor attribution in the commit MESSAGE, never the git author field. Check `vercel ls`/API after the first push; "UNKNOWN/BLOCKED" state means this.
- **Merge content overlays at SECTION level, never chapter level** — a chapter-level `Object.assign` lets a later overlay silently drop an earlier overlay's sections (this bug hid a finished article once).
- **Playwright full-page screenshots race IntersectionObserver reveals** — below-fold sections appear blank in stitched captures. Scroll through the page first, or don't gate content-critical sections behind reveal animations.
- Agents integrating content branches that fork from old shells: take the CONTENT layer only (`git checkout <branch> -- content/ src/content/...`), never merge whole — stale shell files will revert redesigns.
- API editors should always echo `baseSha` from GET into POST or they get last-write-wins instead of 409 conflict protection.
- Grep pitfalls: JS object keys without hyphens are often unquoted — searching for `"key"` gives false "missing content" results.
- zod schema must `strictObject` and mirror types.ts exactly; keep a pointer comment in types.ts so drift is caught in review.

## Env vars (production)

| var | purpose |
|---|---|
| `SITE_PASSWORD` | read gate passphrase (code fallback ok for bootstrap) |
| `CMS_GITHUB_TOKEN` | fine-grained PAT, one repo, Contents R/W — the user must paste this themselves (never move their credentials between services for them) |
| `CMS_AGENT_TOKEN` | random bearer for agent edits (generate, store in `.env.local`) |
| `EDIT_PASSWORD` | optional: splits write access from read access |

## Success criteria

- `pnpm build` green with all sections prerendered; lint clean; parity gate passed.
- Both themes screenshot-verified desktop + mobile; no horizontal overflow.
- Live loop proven end-to-end: browser edit → attributed commit → auto-deploy → visible → revert from `/changes` → site restored. Prove it with a marker block you add and then remove.
- Unauthed `/api/cms/*` returns 401 JSON; gate redirects everything else; `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` present.
