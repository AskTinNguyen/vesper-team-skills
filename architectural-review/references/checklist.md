## Red Flags 🚩

Watch for these common issues:

1. **Bedroom doors at end of long hallway** (feng shui concern)
2. **Bathroom in center of floor plan** (no natural vent)
3. **Kitchen isolated from dining** (poor flow for serving)
4. **Master bedroom over garage** (noise, fumes)
5. **Stairs as only way between main spaces** (circulation bottleneck)
6. **No transition from outside to inside** (missing foyer)
7. **Bedroom directly off living room** (privacy)
8. **All bathrooms on one side** (plumbing not optimized)
