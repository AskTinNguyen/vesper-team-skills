# Feng Shui Guide for Residential Design

## Core Principles

### Chi (Energy) Flow
- Chi should flow smoothly through the home
- Avoid sharp corners pointing at living spaces (poison arrows)
- Prevent chi from rushing through (straight lines from front to back)
- Allow chi to meander naturally

### Yin and Yang Balance
- **Yang spaces:** Living room, kitchen, dining (active, bright)
- **Yin spaces:** Bedrooms, meditation areas (calm, subdued)
- Balance light and dark, high and low, soft and hard

### Five Elements
| Element | Colors | Shapes | Areas |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Wood | Green, Brown | Rectangular | East, Southeast |
| Fire | Red, Orange, Pink | Triangular | South |
| Earth | Yellow, Beige, Brown | Square | Center, NE, SW |
| Metal | White, Gray, Gold | Round | West, Northwest |
| Water | Blue, Black | Wavy | North |

## Room-by-Room Guidelines

### Main Entrance (Ming Tang)

**DO:**
- ✅ Create a welcoming, well-lit entrance
- ✅ Keep entrance clear and uncluttered
- ✅ Use a solid front door (not glass)
- ✅ Ensure door opens inward
- ✅ Have adequate foyer space (chi collection area)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Direct view to back door (chi rushes through)
- ❌ Stairs directly facing entrance
- ❌ Mirror reflecting the front door
- ❌ Bathroom visible from entrance
- ❌ Cluttered or dark entrance

**Remedies:**
- Use a screen or partition to redirect chi
- Add plants to slow and redirect flow
- Place a rug or artwork to define the space

### Living Room

**Command Position:**
- Main sofa should face the entrance
- Solid wall behind seating
- Clear view of door without being directly in line

**Layout:**
- ✅ Balanced furniture arrangement
- ✅ Round or oval coffee tables (soften energy)
- ✅ Good natural light
- ✅ Plants in corners (activate stagnant chi)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Seating with back to door
- ❌ Exposed beams over seating
- ❌ Sharp corners pointing at seats
- ❌ TV as focal point (consider balance)

### Master Bedroom

**Bed Placement - Critical:**
1. **Command Position:** See the door from bed, but not directly in line
2. **Solid wall:** Headboard against solid wall
3. **Balance:** Equal space on both sides of bed
4. **Not facing door directly:** Called "coffin position"
5. **Not under window:** Lacks support
6. **Not under beam:** Creates pressure

**DO:**
- ✅ Matching nightstands (partnership balance)
- ✅ Soft, calming colors
- ✅ Quality bedding and mattress
- ✅ Remove work items from bedroom

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Mirror facing the bed
- ❌ Water features in bedroom
- ❌ Exercise equipment in bedroom
- ❌ Electronics near head
- ❌ Storage under bed (if unavoidable, keep organized)

**En-suite Bathroom:**
- Keep bathroom door closed
- Toilet lid down
- Good ventilation
- Separate from sleeping area if possible

### Kitchen

**Stove Position - Most Important:**
- Cook should see entrance while cooking
- Not directly facing sink (fire vs water conflict)
- Not under window (fire element weakened)
- Not directly facing toilet door

**Triangle Relationship:**
- Stove (fire) and sink (water) should not be directly opposite
- Refrigerator (water/metal) placement matters
- Ideal: Triangle arrangement with adequate spacing

**DO:**
- ✅ Clean, organized kitchen
- ✅ Working burners (wealth symbol)
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ Fresh food visible

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Stove next to sink
- ❌ Stove facing refrigerator
- ❌ Cluttered counters
- ❌ Broken appliances

### Dining Room

**Table Shape:**
- Round: Best for family harmony
- Oval: Good flow
- Rectangular: Acceptable, soften corners
- Square: Less ideal for larger families

**DO:**
- ✅ Even number of chairs
- ✅ Good lighting over table
- ✅ Mirror reflecting table (doubles abundance)
- ✅ Near kitchen but not in kitchen

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Table directly under beam
- ❌ Toilet visible from dining
- ❌ Chair backs to door/window

### Bathroom

**General Rules:**
- Always keep toilet lid down
- Keep bathroom doors closed
- Good ventilation essential
- Drains symbolize money leaving - keep clean

**Location Concerns:**
- ❌ Above main entrance
- ❌ Center of home
- ❌ Visible from main entrance
- ❌ Facing kitchen stove
- ❌ Sharing wall with bed headboard

**Remedies:**
- Plants to absorb negative energy
- Good lighting and mirrors
- Earthy colors to ground water element

### Home Office

**Desk Position:**
- Command position (see door)
- Solid wall behind (support)
- Not facing wall (blocks opportunity)
- Not directly in line with door

**DO:**
- ✅ Organized workspace
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ Plants for growth energy
- ✅ Inspiring artwork

## Structural Considerations

### Stairs

**Good:**
- Curved stairs (chi flows smoothly)
- Solid risers (contains chi)
- Well-lit

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Stairs facing main door directly
- ❌ Spiral stairs in center of home
- ❌ Open risers (chi falls through)
- ❌ Stairs ending at bedroom door

### Beams

Exposed beams create downward pressure:
- ❌ Over bed, desk, stove, dining table
- **Remedy:** Paint same color as ceiling, hang bamboo flutes

### Columns/Pillars

Sharp corners create poison arrows:
- **Remedy:** Wrap with plants, soften with fabric, round the edges

### Windows

- Balance of windows to walls (not too many, not too few)
- Windows should not be larger than doors
- Clean windows = clear opportunities

- 9: Longevity
- 6: Smooth path
- Avoid: 4 (sounds like death in Chinese)

### Orientation

- Avoid north-facing bedroom (cold energy)
