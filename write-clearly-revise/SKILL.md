# Write Clearly — REVISE (self-critique + multi-subagent validation)

This is the workflow to run any draft through Abbott's rules to a verified result. It has
three stages: **(A) checklist revision**, **(B) self-critique against the source**, and
**(C) multi-subagent validation**. It works for prose, essays, emails, documentation,
release notes, prompts — any English that must be clear and forcible.

## A. Checklist revision (three passes)

Load the relevant part skills and make three passes. Do NOT mix passes; each has a single
lens, so violations surface cleanly.

**Pass 1 — WORDS (load `write-clearly-words`).** For each sentence, check Rules 1–14b:
exact sense (1); no exaggeration (2); no circumlocution/"fine writing" (3); the small words
*not/and/any/only/that* unambiguous (4, 4a); pronouns have one clear antecedent (5);
reported speech clear (6–6b); participles explicit (7); who/which vs that right, no "and
which" (8, 9); relative equivalents not causing ambiguity, antecedent repeated (10, 10a');
particular terms where they add force (11, 12); verbal nouns avoidable (11a); metaphors
unmixed and apt (13–14b).

**Pass 2 — WORD ORDER (load `write-clearly-word-order`).** For each sentence, Rules 15–45:
emphatic words at start/end (15–15b); emphatic subject/object placed deliberately (16, 17);
one clear strongest emphasis (18); related words adjacent (19–25); no harmful parentheses
(26); conditionals and "that"-clauses and infinitives kept distinct (27–29); suspense held,
not over-held, if-clauses first, no trailing "not…/which…" (30–34); subjects, prepositions,
conjunctions, verbs repeated where omission muddies (35–38); climax not bathos (39–40);
no unexpected construction change (40a); antithesis/epigram in reach (41–42); one principal
subject per sentence (43); sentences visibly connected (44–45).

**Pass 3 — BREVITY (load `write-clearly-brevity`).** Rules 46–56: compress via metaphor,
word-for-phrase, participles, implication, apposition, condensation — but **clearness first**
(56). Delete tautology in both senses (same word, same meaning) (54).

For each violation produce: the original text, the rule number, and the rewrite. Rewrites
must fix the flagged defect without introducing a new one.

## B. Self-critique against the source

Before shipping, challenge your own rewrites:
1. **Faithfulness check:** for every rule/example you cited, verify the wording against
   `write-clearly/references/how-to-write-clearly.txt` (the verbatim book text). Flag any
   paraphrase that changed Abbott's meaning.
2. **Clarity-vs-brevity check:** for every Brevity edit, confirm you did not sacrifice clarity.
3. **Did-rewrite-introduce check:** read each rewrite as if you were a hostile reader — does
   the "fix" create a new ambiguity (e.g. a pronoun now dangling, an adverb now misplaced)?
4. **Emphasis check:** confirm each sentence still has one clear principal subject and a
   deliberate emphasis position.

## C. Multi-subagent validation orchestration

Spawn **independent** subagents in parallel via `delegate_task` (batch mode, up to 3 at
once — run two batches for 4 roles). Give each the full source text path, the original
draft, and your revised draft. Each returns claims + verdicts; you must verify their
outputs (subagent self-reports are not proof — check their cited rule numbers and page
quotes against the reference file yourself before trusting them).

**Role 1 — CLARITY reviewer:** Is the revised text unambiguous at word and sentence level?
Flag any pronoun, "only/not/that/and/or", dangling modifier, or misplaced adverb. Cite
rule numbers (1, 4, 5, 8, 20, 21, 25…).

**Role 2 — BREVITY reviewer:** Is the revision needlessly wordy anywhere? Flag tautology
(54) and any phrase compressible to a word (47a). But confirm none of its cuts harmed
clarity (56).

**Role 3 — EVIDENCE reviewer:** Verify every example and every rule-reference in the
deliverable matches the source text verbatim (check against the reference file). Report
exact mismatches; do not assume the writer was right.

**Role 4 — RED-TEAM challenger:** Attempt to MISREAD the revised text. Give the most
plausible wrong interpretation of each complex sentence. If a sentence can be read two
ways, it fails — cite the offending rule (5, 8, 21, 25, 30a, 43…).

### Adjudication
- If any role reports a clear violation you agree with, fix it, then re-run the relevant
  reviewers once (do not loop indefinitely).
- If a role's claim does not survive your own check of the cited rule against the source,
  record it as rejected with the reason.
- Emit a final **verdict table**: rule / original / revised / reviewer / accepted-or-rejected.
- Deliver the revised text only after roles 1–4 are clean or their findings adjudicated.

## Notes
- The full book text is available at `write-clearly/references/how-to-write-clearly.txt`
  for verbatim quoting and verification by every subagent.
- Keep subagent contexts self-contained: pass in the draft text and the reference path;
  they do not share your conversation.
- This workflow is itself recursive in spirit — if your final prose is long, run the same
  three passes on it. Abbott's Rule 56 is the guardrail: never let any process, brevity
  included, obscure the meaning.
